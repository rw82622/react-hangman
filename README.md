# Hangman!
In this exercise, you will recreate the word game Hangman.

In addition to building the app end-to-end independently, you'll learn the power of chaining array transformations (like map and filter) - a pillar of functional programming.

## Release 0:
The interface should contain the following components:
- A component that displays the puzzle word (letters should be separated by spaces).  Letters that haven't been guessed should be displayed as an underscore - letters that have been guessed should be displayed.
- A component that contains a text input and a button to submit the guessed letter.  If the letter submitted has already been guessed, display an `alert()`.
- A component that displays letters that are not part of the puzzle word.

One last requirement: there should only be two properties within `App.js`'s state:
 - **puzzle** - this should be the puzzle word (a string)
 - **guessedLetters** - this should be an array of all the letters that were guessed.

A JSON array is below... store it and import it appropriately in the application that you create.

```

## Release 1:
- If someone guesses more 6 letters that aren't part of the word, an alert displaying that the game is over should be displayed.

## Stretch Challenge:
- Incorporate a 3rd party API to get random words (instead of relying on a limited list of words)
